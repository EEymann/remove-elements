const numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

//You can practice using the push and shift methods in the JavaScript console.
//For example, you can find out how many elements are in an array using the length property, numbers.length, which returns five elements.
//Add an item to the end, using push. numbers.push(600);
//To remove an element from the end of the array, type numbers.pop()
//This returns 600 because the value 600 was the last element in the numbers array.
//To remove an element from the beginning of an array, type: numbers.shift()
//Shift also returns the first element, after removing it.
